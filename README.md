# carreejoh-portfolio
A website for future employers to view and see my work.


# Description
This is my first portfolio with every project I've completed, and a few fillers to give the site content and shape. The site provides basic interaction with hover pseudo elements, and has links for my contact information, the websites listed, as well as around the website. It is a work in progress but a good place to start never-the-less. It makes very heavy use of css and html, and those are the only two languages in the project. 

# Installation

I alone built the site, with multiple resources for help. Thank you to the bootcamp team and W3Schools!

# For The Teachers
I could not for the life of me figure out how to make the "About Me" header fit onto one line.
I also know that style is not necessarily what the website will be graded on, but checkout the css I marked out, and 
I'd love your input on whether or not I should've kept it. Thanks!
