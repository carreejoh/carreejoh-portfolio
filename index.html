                <p>I grew up in Salt Lake City for the majority of my life, and have been incredibly blessed to call Utah my home.
                My father was a mechanical engineer, and I originally followed his path and went to school for Mechanical Engineering, but 
                I quickly lost interest in college and the opportunities it had for me. Even without traditional school I still loved the challenge and immense satisfaction
                of building and creating things. This eventually led me to coding and I've been enjoying it ever since. I'm currently enrolled 
                in a coding bootcamp through the University of Utah, and it has been the best decision I've ever made. I'm working towards becoming a 
                full-stack web developer and can't wait to see where this path takes me.
