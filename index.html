                <div>
                <p>My name is Carter Johnson, I grew up in Salt Lake City for the majority of my life, and have been incredibly blessed to call Utah my home.
                    My father was a mechanical engineer, and I originally followed his path and went to school for Mechanical Engineering, but 
                    I quickly lost interest in college and the opportunities it had for me. Even without traditional school I still loved the challenge and immense satisfaction
                    of building and creating things. This eventually led me to coding and I've been enjoying it ever since. I'm currently enrolled 
                    in a coding bootcamp through the University of Utah, and it has been the best decision I've ever made. I'm working towards becoming a 
                    full-stack web developer and can't wait to see where this path takes me.  
                </p>
